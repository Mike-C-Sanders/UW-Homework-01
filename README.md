# UW-Homework-01

## Description

First homework assignment for the UW boot camp. This is a refactoring assignment, meaning we are making changes to existing code. For this particular assignment, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site, which currently doesn't follow accessibility standards. My objective is to change the codebase to follow accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

For more information on web accessibility check out the references and resources section in this readme file.
